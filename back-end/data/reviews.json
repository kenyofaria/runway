It seems far too easy to use as a platform for bullying them. \n\nWell it finally happened. A client of mine came in looking void of life after learning their lifelong friend shot himself in the head after a former girlfriend and her friend posted horrendous accusations of him. Accusations that people closest to him can verify were untrue. I hope his family pursues legal action against this poorly thought out app. Nice job tech bros."
